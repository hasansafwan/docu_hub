Cell Structure and Function
===========================


Cells are the basic units of life. They can be prokaryotic (without a nucleus) or eukaryotic (with a nucleus). Key structures include:
1. Nucleus: Contains genetic material.
2. Mitochondria: Produce energy (ATP).
3. Ribosomes: Synthesize proteins.
4. Cell membrane: Regulates the entry and exit of substances.

Understanding cell structures is vital for studying biology and medicine.
