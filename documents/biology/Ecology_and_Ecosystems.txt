Ecology and Ecosystems
======================


Ecology is the study of organisms and their interactions with the environment. Ecosystems are communities of living organisms and their physical surroundings. Components include:
1. Producers: Plants that produce energy via photosynthesis.
2. Consumers: Animals that consume plants or other animals.
3. Decomposers: Organisms breaking down dead material.

Maintaining ecological balance is crucial for sustaining life on Earth.
