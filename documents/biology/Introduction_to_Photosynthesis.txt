Introduction to Photosynthesis
==============================


Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy. 
Key stages:
1. Light-dependent reactions: Occur in the thylakoid membranes, producing ATP and NADPH.
2. Calvin Cycle: Occurs in the stroma, converting carbon dioxide into glucose.

Chlorophyll in chloroplasts plays a crucial role by absorbing light energy.
