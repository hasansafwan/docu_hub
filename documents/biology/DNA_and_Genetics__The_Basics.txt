DNA and Genetics: The Basics
============================


DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information. Key features:
1. Double helix structure made of nucleotides (A, T, C, G).
2. Genes: Specific sequences that code for proteins.

Genetics explores inheritance, including Mendel's laws, dominant and recessive traits, and mutations that lead to genetic variation.
