Human Nervous System: Overview
==============================


The nervous system controls and coordinates body functions. It consists of:
1. Central Nervous System (CNS): Brain and spinal cord.
2. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): Nerves connecting the CNS to the body.

Neurons are the primary cells transmitting signals. Disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's affect the nervous system's function.
